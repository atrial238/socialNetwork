# React application "Social network" 

### `It is deployed on netlify:` <br>https://socialnetwork238.netlify.app/

This is one of my first applications that use React, made by the lessons on youtube.

Here you can get users from the server, go to their page, add and remove a user from your friends.\
It is also possible to upload your avatar to the server, change the status, name, information about \
me, add contacts. There also are errors handle. When developing the project was used typescript.

The following libraries are used here:

-material-ui\
-redux\
-axiox\
-final-form\
-formik\
-node-sass\
-react-final-form\
-react-router-dom\
-redux-form\
-redux-thunk
